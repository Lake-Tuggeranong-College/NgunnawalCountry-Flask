# Presentations

These presentations will be used throughout the project. 

## Viewing the presentations

The presentations are written in markdown and can be viewed in a number of ways:

1 - Using the [Marp for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) extension.

Open Visual Studio Code on your computer, and install the extension linked above. Then click the Preview button to open the presentation.

and you should be presented with this:

2 - On Github, however you will only be able to read the raw markdown, not as a presentation.
